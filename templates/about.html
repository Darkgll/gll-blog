                <p class="about_me">In <strong>2019</strong> I have graduated from the <em>Financial University under
                    the Government
                    of the Russian Federation (Barnaul Branch)</em>.
                    After graduating, I was invited to work in a new startup project for the development of an
                    educational cryptocurrency online exchange. In time, I realized, that this work will not give me a
                    good future. Due to the pandemic,
                    the project was closed. After this i decided to search for what I really want to do in my life.
                    I wanted to do something interesting, something that can be really beneficial for people, not only
                    for myself,
                    and at the end, I have made a very important decision to learn programming.
                </p>
                <p class="about_me">On <strong> December 2021</strong> I finally got my first job in the company
                    <em>Sovcombank Technologies</em>.
                    With each day there I'm getting more and more valuable experience.
                    That thing, that when I came there I could spend a week doing one project, and now I need just few
                    hours, makes me see how much progress I'm doing
                    there. And with each new task for me, with each new piece of technology I'm working with, I'm doing
                    more and more steps forward in my Programmer journey. And of course, there I'm working with people,
                    who are not familiar with programming but just want something to work, to make their jobs easier
                    (Mostly doing for them automation bots, that could do something a few seconds, while they did it
                    for hours:D).
                    I've got more experience with database, overall code structure, got experience with things like
                    using Python to make changes in the Active Directory, and of course a lot of work with APIs and
                    huge packs of data.<br>
                    I can say it without doubts, that decision to become a programmer was the best decision in my life.
